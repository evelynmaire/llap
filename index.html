      <h2>Where Do I Fit In?</h2>
      <p>Here on 21st Century Earth, I'm a Front-End Web Developer keen to learn from your engineering team. I make okay cups of coffee, great cups of tea (earl grey, hot) and will whip your ass at Mario Kart 64. However, if I was from any of the numerous other multiverses, this is where I'd belong;</p>
      <ul class="games">
        <li><img class="profiles" src="images/st.jpg">
          <p class="caption">If I joined Starfleet, I'd be in Command, possibly piloting a starship somewhere. (Also this one time, I was in the same room as Nichelle Nichols and it made my life.)</p>
        </li>
        <li><img class="profiles" src="images/got.jpg">
          <p class="caption">If I were born in Westeros, I'd be in House Stark. Emotionally motivated, loyal to my friends, sometimes reckless, and constantly complaining about the impending cold weather.</p>
        </li>
        <li><img class="profiles" src="images/twd.jpg">
          <p class="caption">And let's face it. Everyone likes to think they'd be the bad-ass wisecracker zombie killer at the end of the world... but I'd definitely go within the first few hours and be a zombie from then on. I just couldn't hack it without wifi.</p>
        </li>
        <li><img class="profiles" src="images/hp.jpg">
          <p class="caption">And yeah, I know you don't make a Harry Potter game (yet) but I feel it's important you know that I am 110% Hufflepuff.</p>
